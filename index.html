                                                Memories made at the cottage with family and friends are the stuff of life.They are what carry us 
                                                through the cold winter days. Sundial Island is a beautiful island located in Lake of the Woods near Kenora, Ontario.
                                                It is also the location of our family cottage. A two and a half hour drive from Winnipeg to Henderson’s
                                                Marina and a short boat ride later we arrive on our dock and unpack our provisions for the weekend.
                                                Coolers and crates, books, bug spray, bags of luggage are hauled to the different out buildings and everyone 
                                                finds their home away from home for the weekend.</p>
                                    <p>
                                                Sitting in the sunshine on the dock we linger over thermos’ of coffee and discuss plans for the day.
                                                Should we paddle board in the early morning sun? What projects should we undertake? What should we
                                                make for happy hour? When should we go fishing and what book should I read? 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                                In warm sunshine or on cool rainy days the cottage is the place where family and 
                                                friends tell stories and make memories.  Collective memories that we store away for the 
                                                long winter days when we dream of spending time together again at the cottage.
